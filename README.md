# [My Project 2](https://quiz.dazl.ie)  General Knowledge Quiz

Hi! My name is Graham. In this README page were you will find out a little about me, my website, my coding journey, my projects and who has influenced me in the development of this website.

This is my second course project, by now I have gained a little experience but still very much a novice. Of the options for this project I thought a quiz would be fun with the challenging bit of writing good questions.

I hope you have fun.


# Design.

For this project I decided to do a quiz as I love a good pub quiz. Quiz's in general can be very enjoyable and hopefully I acheived that. The color scheme for this website is very much tied in with the background image, the chocolate colored font adding some warmth with the light grey adding a bit of contrast. The font used on this project is <u>Cinzel</u>, I choosed this font as I think it adds some sharpness to the overall look. My process of constructing this project was to source all images, including favicon, draw up a mock layout then begin with the HTML. To dress everything up, CSS was added and to make it all dance, Javascript provided all the glitz and glamour.

## <b>Main Page:</b>
The man page has a lovely background of the Trinity College Library with an instruction box in the center containing the quiz start button. A basic main page with only the essentials with a contrasting grren button just waiting to be pressed. In the bottom left contains the copyright and right of that is an animated icon for email contact.

## <b> Questions Page:</b>
The question page has the same background as the main page with the question box centered. This box will contain a question and multiple choice answers. A correct answer will be highlighted in green, an incorrect answer will be red.
